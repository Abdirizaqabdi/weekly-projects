# Build a project every week
In order to increase your coding skills we created this *Weekly Projects* challenge.

Every week you'll get a new challenge (see table below) that you can complete. 

Each challenge will have:
- a description
- a list of user stories (tasks / todos)
- all the resources you need in order to complete
